Stock / ETF Data
-----------------

Split Adjusted - prices adjusted for stock splits and reverse splits only
Split+Dividend Adjusted - prices adjusted for both splits and dividends

-----------------

All options for over 5800 US equities and indices from 2010.

Full historical option chains, including closing price, bid/ask quotes, implied volatilities (for both put and ask), Greeks (delta, gamma, vega, theta and rho) for both puts and calls.


Futures Data 
--------------

We provide both continuous data (ie a single series of chained contracts) as well as individual contract data (ie data for each futures contract delivered in a single file per contract).

We provide two types of continuous data :
Unadjusted - actual historic traded prices with no adjustments 
Adjusted - prices adjusted for price jumps on contract roll date, more details are available at

In addition, indivudal futures contracts in the 1-min and 1-day timeframes are included.


More details on the adjustment process for stocks, ETFs and Futures is at https://firstratedata.com/about/price_adjustment


Format
-------
Data is in the format : {DateTime (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss), Open, High, Low, Close, Volume}  
(daily futures data also included open interest in the final field)

- Volume Numbers are in individual shares, contracts (or for FX the base currency)
- Timestamps run from the start of the period (eg 1min bars stamped 09:30 run from 09:30.00 to 09:30.59)
- Times with zero volume are omitted (thus gaps in the data sequence are when there have been no trades)



Updates
-------
This dataset is updated daily (update files are available by 3am on the following trading day).

New stock and ETF tickers are added at the end of every week.
